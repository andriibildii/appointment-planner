# Appointment Planner

In this project, using functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments.

The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

## Project Requirements

### `App` Requirements:

- Keep track of the contacts and appointments data, each being an array of objects
- Define a callback function that, given a name, phone number, and email, adds a new contact object with that data to the array of contacts
- Define a callback function that, given a title, contact, date, and time, adds a new appointment object with that data to the array of appointments
- Pass the array of contacts and the appropriate callback function as props to the `ContactsPage` component
- Pass the appointments array, contacts array, and the add appointment function as props to the `AppointmentsPage` component

------------
### `ContactsPage` Requirements:

- Receive two props:
- - The current list of contacts
- - A callback function for adding a new contact
- Keep track of three local state values: the current name, phone, and email entered into the form
- Check for duplicates whenever the name in the form changes and indicate the name is a duplicate
- Only add a new contact on form submission if it does not duplicate an existing contact’s name
- A successful submission should clear the form
- In the Add Contact section, render a ContactForm with the following passed via props:
- - local state variables
- - local state variable setter functions
- - handleSubmit callback function
- In the Contacts section, render a TileList with the contact array passed via props

------------
### ContactForm Requirements:

- Render a `form` with:
- The `onSubmit` attribute set
- 3 controlled `<input>` elements, one for each piece of contact data
- A submit button
- Include a pattern attribute to the phone `<input> ` with a regex that matches the phone locale of your preference

------------
### TileList Requirements:

- Receive one prop:
- An array of objects to render as a list
- Use the array passed via `props` to iteratively render `Tile` components, passing each object in the array as a prop to each rendered `Tile` component
- The requirements for the `TileList` component are generalized and allow it to be shared by the `ContactsPage` and `AppointmentsPage` components. As long as an array of objects with either the contact data or appointments data is passed then the content will be handled appropriately.

------------
### Tile Requirements:

- Receive one prop:
- An object
- Iterate over the values in the object, passed in via props, and render a `<p> ` element for each value
- Give a `className` of `"tile-title" `to the first `<p>` element
- Give a `className` of `"tile" `to all other `<p>` elements
- Just like the `TileList` component, the `Tile` component is generalized to work with data from any object. This allows it to be used in both the `ContactsPage` and `AppointmentsPage` components.

------------
### AppointmentsPage Requirements:

- Receive three props:
- - The current list of appointments
- - The current list of contacts
- - A callback function for adding a new appointment
- Keep track of four local state variables, the current title, contact, date, and time entered into the form
- Add a new appointment on form submission
- Clear the form on submission
- In the Add Appointment section, render an `AppointmentForm` with the following passed via `props`:
- - local state variables
- - local state variable setter functions
- - `handleSubmit` callback function
- In the Appointments section, render a `TileList` with the appointment array passed via `props`

------------
### AppointmentForm Requirements:

- Render a `form` with:
- - The `onSubmit` attribute set to the callback function passed in via - props
- - 3 controlled `input` components, to be used for the title, date and time appointment data
- - A `ContactPicker` component with the contacts list passed in via props
- - A submit button
- Use `getTodayString()` to set the `min` attribute of the date `input`

------------
### ContactPicker Requirements:

- Receive 2 props:
- - The array of contacts
- - A callback function to handle when the `onChange` event is triggered
- Render a `select` element with the `onChange` attribute set to the callback passed in via props
- Have a default first `option` element that indicates no contact is selected
- Iteratively add `option` elements using the contact names from the array passed in via props

------------
### In addition:
- created utilities file for ID generation
- added the ability to delete added contacts and appointments
